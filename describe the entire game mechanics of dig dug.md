# describe the entire game mechanics of dig dug

Dig Dug is a single‑screen arcade action game where you dig tunnels through dirt to eliminate all enemies either by inflating them until they pop or by crushing them with falling rocks. Each round ends as soon as every enemy is destroyed or the last one escapes off the surface, then the game advances to the next, faster and harder stage.[^1][^2][^4]

## Player, movement, and digging

- You control Taizo Hori (“Dig Dug”), who starts at the surface and moves in four directions on a grid, carving tunnels as he walks through dirt tiles.[^4][^1]
- Moving through open tunnels is slightly faster than through dirt, so existing tunnels become “paths” for both you and enemies.[^5][^4]
- You have a fixed number of lives; contact with an enemy, Fygar’s fire, or being crushed by a rock costs one life and restarts the round layout.[^6][^4]


## Enemies and their behavior

There are two enemy types, both starting embedded in dirt at fixed positions each round.[^2][^5]

- Pooka: Red, goggle‑wearing round monsters that move through tunnels and can also turn into ghost‑eyes to phase through dirt to reach you.[^2][^5]
- Fygar: Green dragon that moves like Pooka but can periodically breathe a horizontal flame while facing left or right, lethal if you line up with it.[^4][^2]

Enemies normally follow tunnel paths but can shift into a ghost form (just eyes) to drift through dirt, where they move slower, cannot attack, and cannot be harmed; they become solid again upon reaching an open space. When only one enemy remains, it often tries to escape: it rises straight up to the surface and runs toward a screen edge; if it gets away, you simply lose the opportunity for those points and the round ends.[^2][^4]

## Pump weapon and inflation mechanic

Dig Dug’s only weapon is a short‑range harpoon connected to an air pump.[^4][^2]

- Firing: Press the action button to fire the pump straight out in the direction you face; if an enemy is within range and line of sight (including through a thin dirt wall), the hose latches onto it and Dig Dug is locked in place.[^2][^4]
- Inflating: Tap or hold the button to inflate the enemy; each “pump” step swells it more until it bursts, which permanently removes it and scores points.[^4][^2]
- Partial inflation: If you stop pumping or move away before it pops, the hose disconnects and the enemy slowly deflates. During this partial‑inflated state the enemy is stunned and can be safely passed through; once fully deflated it returns to normal behavior and becomes dangerous again.[^6][^2][^4]

Dig Dug is vulnerable while pumping because he cannot move until you break the connection, so timing and positioning are core to the combat loop.[^5][^6]

## Rocks, gravity, and environmental kills

Rocks are solid objects embedded in the dirt that you cannot dig through but can undermine.[^2][^4]

- Triggering a rock: Dig directly under a rock and then move out from under it; after a brief shake, it falls straight down until it hits a tunnel floor or the bottom of the screen, then shatters and disappears.[^4][^2]
- Crushing enemies: Any enemy in the vertical path of the falling rock is crushed and instantly destroyed for bonus points; killing multiple enemies with one rock yields higher rock‑kill bonuses.[^2][^4]
- Risk: Dig Dug himself can be crushed by the rock; you may safely stand under a rock indefinitely until it starts shaking, but once it moves you must be clear of its path.[^6][^4]

Dropping any two rocks in a stage spawns a bonus vegetable (or similar item) at the center of the map for a few seconds, which can be collected for points before it vanishes.[^6][^4]

## Stages, layers, and scoring rules

Each round is one fixed screen of dirt, divided into several horizontal color layers, plus the surface at the top.[^4][^2]

- Clearing requirement: Destroy all enemies (or let the last one escape) to finish the round and move to the next.[^6][^4]
- Difficulty scaling: As rounds increase, initial enemy layouts become more complex, enemies move faster, use ghosting more aggressively, and Fygars’ fire becomes a more frequent threat.[^5][^2]

Scoring is tied both to how you kill enemies and where:[^5][^4]

- Pump kills: Each Pooka or Fygar is worth more points the deeper the layer where it dies; Fygars killed horizontally (so you risk their fire line) are worth extra.[^4]
- Rock kills: Rock crushes award a separate rock bonus that increases with the number of enemies killed by that single rock.[^4]
- Vegetables: The central bonus item after two rock drops gives points that increase in later rounds.[^5][^4]


## Game over and advanced play dynamics

- You lose a life on enemy contact, Fygar flame, or rock crush; losing all lives ends the game and your final score is recorded.[^6][^4]
- There is no fixed ending; the game continues with ever‑faster enemy patterns, effectively making it a score‑attack survival game.[^8][^2]

Mechanically, the depth‑based scoring, rock bonuses, vegetable timing, ghost‑movement, and last‑enemy escape behavior combine to create higher‑level tactics: luring groups under rocks, partially inflating enemies to slow or stack them, and carving “funnels” or choke tunnels that maximize both safety and points while managing risk from Fygars’ horizontal fire lines.[^8][^5][^4]
